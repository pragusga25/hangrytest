# Node.js Server Readme

This README provides instructions on how to set up and run a Node.js server using npm. Follow the steps below to get your server up and running.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Ensure that you have Node.js installed. You can download it from the official website.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pragusga25/hangrytest.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```
   cd hangrytest
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Server

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the Node.js server using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will execute the script specified in the `package.json` file under the "scripts" section. In this case, it runs the `dev` script, which is commonly used for development environments.

The server should now be running, and you should see output indicating that the server has started. By default, the server may be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users`. Open this URL in your web browser to see the server in action.
